          group, leaving everyone else as juniors. The four members had two programming teachers. The first teacher being Patty Bacha who retired in 2019.The following year, Christopher Smith became the new teacher and was the one who created the
          teams of rows. Gaming Bucket's members have been learning to work as a team with not only their own team, but the other teams. For a few moths half way in the school year of 2020, all the teams (A through F) where working on a JS browser fighting
          game. The finnal project was never finished due to the COVID-19 out break and all projects were cancelled. Now for a finnal project for the school year, all teams have to create an website to show all memebers skills and how they all work
          as a team. And Gaming Bucket works as if each member is a gear in a well oiled machine, meaning that we work together very well. As prof, The four members have created this website together. All credit to each member will be on the <a href="portfolioPage.html">Portfolio Project Page</a>.
